When you bring a new plant home, it may suffer at first until it gets acclimated to conditions in your home.\nLights In our area, violets do best under fluorescent lights for 10 – 12 hours per day. If not available, violets will grow best in natural light in a north or east window. If grown in a south or west window a curtain should be placed between the bright sunlight and the plant. If leaves start to yellow, give the plant less light per day or move it away from the light. Leaves may curl around the pot if too much light and reach up when they need more light. Adequate light is the most important factor needed for African violets to bloom well. When one side of the plant raises, turn the plant towards the light so that side gets more light so the leaves grow flat. Plants with light colored blossoms need less light than those with darker blooms. Plants need a minimum of eight hours of darkness each 24 hours to distribute food produced during the light period. Watering: More African violets die from overwatering than from any other cause. Water which is fit for drinking is used warm to water violets from the top or bottom when the soil at the top is dry (middle of the soil is still moist). Plants do not like to sit in a saucer of water and will rot if kept this way. Let water with chlorine stand overnight before using. Water drops left on leaves in direct sun will cause leaf spots. Plastic pots feel light when water is needed. If a plant is dry and wilting, water sparingly and let stand for several hours before continuing to water.\nAir Fresh circulating air should reach your plants at all times. Avoid cold drafts directly on plants. They dislike a stale atmosphere and it is an invitation to mildew.\nHumidity Humidity is ideal at 40% to 50%. Some simple ways to increase humidity is to elevate plants on pebbles, overturned pots so the plants don’t sit in water are a couple of ways to increase humidity. Humidifiers are another method in a very dry environment. If you mist or fog with water, be sure the plants do not sit in light until the leaves are dry.\nTemperature The ideal temperature is 65° to 70° at night with a 5 to 10 degree rise during the day. Temperatures below 60° for any extended period will slow the growth. If too high, plants will grow sappy and spindly, with too few blooms which drop before gaining a good size. Better a bit cool than too hot. Soil: There are as many formulas as there are violet growers. In general, soil should be light and easily penetrated by the soft roots. The soil should allow for free passage of air and water.\nFeeding There are several recommendations, but any water soluble fertilizer can be used. Recommendations are from 1/16th to 1/8 tsp per gallon for each watering. It is recommended that plain water be used every few weeks. Fertilizer can build up and burn the roots, therefore the plain water can flush out some of built up fertilizer. Always be sure the soil is damp when watering. If the soil is dry, water with plain water.\nGrooming Keep the plants to a single crown (unless a species or trailer). Remove offshoots (new crowns) at the soil line or between leaf stems while small and before the plant shape is spoiled. Remove spent blooms, flower stems ad old bottom leaves. If you drop water on the leaves, remove with a soft cloth. Plants can enjoy a gentle wash with tepid water to keep the leaves lean and pores open. Do not place in or under light until the leaves are dry.\nCommon Troubles: Crown Rot is caused by overwatering Leaf Wilt is caused by overwatering, or the plat is too dry Brown spots on the leaves is a burn from water on the leaf Mildew can be from rapid changes in temperature and lack of air circulation. Can be prevented by war, fresh circulating air Mites are the worst pest, they are invisible to the naked eye. Their presence is indicated by hardening and graying of the center foliage and shortening and twisting of the flower stems. Thrips are very tiny, fast moving insects. They can cause streaked leaves and blossoms, blasted buds and premature dropping of blossoms Mealy bugs (white, cotton-like), some live in the soil and others on the leaves. They are slow moving and can quickly spread The above pests can be removed by keeping your growing area clean and by using various chemicals. Chemicals change on a regular basis, so if you have a problem it is best to research the internet to find out what the current and acceptable chemical can be used safely in your home.

Meetings are fun, educational, and a good opportunity to learn and share knowledge of successfully growing African violets and other Gesneriads. Participation is at your discretion. No member is forced to participate beyond their comfort level. Prepare to have fun and meet people that share a common interest.\nCan I come to a meeting if I did not pay the membership? Yes! We encourage you to come to a few meetings before joining, so that you have the opportunity to get to know us a bit better and see if the club meets your expectations. We limit participation in raffles, door prizes, and purchasing supplies or auction items to members only.\nIf I sign up to bring Door Prizes, how many do I bring? Bringing door prizes is voluntary. You are only expected to bring door prizes if you have signed up to bring them that month. There is no limit to how many door prizes you can bring. It is up to your discretion. Typically members bring in a minimum of three. Door prizes are chosen by raffle at the monthly meeting. You must be a member and be present to win. All raffle money goes into club treasury.\nDo we ever have a meeting where members bring plants and leaves for sale or trade to other members? Members can bring plants for sale or trade. We have an auction at every meeting. You set the price, members bid and the highest bid wins. The money from this auction goes to the club. Typically African violets, Streptocarpus and other gesneriads are brought, but you can bring other types of plants or small non-plant items. You can also bring plants to donate to the Ways and Means table. Members can purchase the plant and the money goes back to the club treasury. It is member\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to dispose of any item that is not bid on or sold at the Ways and Means table.\nDo we ever have \u0026ldquo;open houses\u0026rdquo;, where the group visits other members\u0026rsquo; homes to see their plants and gardens? Activities and Programs for the club are always evolving and input for activities and program ideas are welcome from all members. We have had excursions to outside gardens of interest, both public and private. Membership meetings generally take place in a public venue, but on the rare occasion, we have met at individual members\u0026rsquo; homes.\n","permalink":"https://www.seattleafricanvioletsociety.com/blog/faq/","tags":["faq"],"title":"Membership FAQ"}]
