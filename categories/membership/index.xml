&lt;h4 id="why-should-i-come-to-a-meeting"&gt;Why should I come to a meeting?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meetings are fun, educational, and a good opportunity to learn and share knowledge of successfully growing African violets and other Gesneriads. Participation is at your discretion. No member is forced to participate beyond their comfort level. Prepare to have fun and meet people that share a common interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
